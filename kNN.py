# shouldn't be that hard at least the straigh k-NN going in from the beginning
# given S and given point, compare to S and return majority (must set k first)
# fancy version:  allow user to decide distance measure (euclidean, l-inf, l-1, etc)
#                 use specific k
# data?  binary data (iris data)
